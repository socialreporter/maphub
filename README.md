# Guide to Maphub

## Guide

This is a draft outline of a Maphub guide, to support projects we are working with. There are [official Maphub docs in Gitbook](https://docs.maphub.net/), and a lot of useful tips and solutions in the Maphub [blog](https://maphub.medium.com/) and [forum](https://forum.maphub.net/). I'm here exploring how to bring those together, and supplement with other content developed with projects. I'm in touch with the developer to see if this would be generally useful.
