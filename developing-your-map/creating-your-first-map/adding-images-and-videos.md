# Adding images and videos

Embed &lt;iframe&gt; in popups

It is now possible to embed &lt;iframe&gt;-s in popups. Iframes are used to display interactive snippets from websites, such as from weather stations or videos.

The syntax is very simple, just insert

```text
{iframe src="..."}or{iframe src="..." width="400" height="600"}
```

in the description field.
